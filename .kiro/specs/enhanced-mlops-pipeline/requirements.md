# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Kubeflow ML pipeline with advanced MLOps capabilities including model versioning, comprehensive monitoring, support for multiple algorithms, automated KServe deployment, and enterprise-grade features. The enhancement transforms the current basic pipeline into a production-ready MLOps platform that supports the complete machine learning lifecycle from experimentation to deployment and monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want automated model versioning and registry management, so that I can track model lineage, compare performance across versions, and easily rollback to previous models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is trained THEN the system SHALL automatically assign a semantic version number (major.minor.patch)
2. WHEN a model is saved THEN the system SHALL store comprehensive metadata including training parameters, dataset version, performance metrics, and timestamp
3. WHEN a model performs better than the current production model THEN the system SHALL automatically promote it to staging
4. IF a model fails validation checks THEN the system SHALL reject the model and maintain the current version
5. WHEN a user requests model history THEN the system SHALL provide a complete lineage with performance comparisons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want comprehensive pipeline monitoring and alerting, so that I can proactively identify issues, track performance degradation, and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on execution time, resource usage, and data quality
2. WHEN model performance drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger automated alerts
3. WHEN data drift is detected THEN the system SHALL notify stakeholders and suggest retraining
4. IF pipeline components fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN monitoring dashboards are accessed THEN the system SHALL display real-time pipeline health and historical trends

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want support for multiple ML algorithms and automated algorithm selection, so that I can experiment with different approaches and find the optimal model for my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is initiated THEN the system SHALL support at least 5 different algorithm types (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
2. WHEN algorithm comparison is requested THEN the system SHALL train multiple models in parallel and compare performance
3. WHEN hyperparameter tuning is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize parameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization
4. IF multiple algorithms are trained THEN the system SHALL select the best performing model based on configurable metrics
5. WHEN ensemble methods are requested THEN the system SHALL combine multiple algorithms for improved performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated KServe deployment with canary releases, so that I can deploy models safely to production with minimal downtime and risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is promoted to production THEN the system SHALL automatically create a KServe InferenceService
2. WHEN deploying a new model version THEN the system SHALL implement canary deployment with configurable traffic splitting
3. WHEN canary deployment is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically promote to full production traffic
4. IF canary deployment fails validation THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous version
5. WHEN model endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL provide health checks, load balancing, and auto-scaling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want automated data validation and quality monitoring, so that I can ensure data integrity and catch issues before they affect model performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is ingested THEN the system SHALL validate schema, data types, and value ranges
2. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL quarantine bad data and alert stakeholders
3. WHEN statistical properties change significantly THEN the system SHALL flag potential data drift
4. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent pipeline execution and provide detailed error reports
5. WHEN data lineage is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete traceability from source to model

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and model explainability, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and understand model decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any pipeline action occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed audit information with timestamps and user attribution
2. WHEN model predictions are made THEN the system SHALL provide feature importance and decision explanations
3. WHEN compliance reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive documentation of model development and deployment
4. IF model bias is detected THEN the system SHALL flag potential fairness issues and suggest mitigation strategies
5. WHEN audit trails are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide immutable logs with cryptographic verification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated resource management and cost optimization, so that I can efficiently utilize infrastructure and control operational expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline components are scheduled THEN the system SHALL optimize resource allocation based on workload requirements
2. WHEN training jobs complete THEN the system SHALL automatically scale down resources to minimize costs
3. WHEN resource utilization is low THEN the system SHALL suggest optimization opportunities
4. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and queue management
5. WHEN cost reports are requested THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns by component and time period

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want A/B testing capabilities for model comparison, so that I can validate model improvements in production with real user traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN A/B testing is configured THEN the system SHALL route traffic between model versions based on specified ratios
2. WHEN statistical significance is reached THEN the system SHALL automatically determine the winning model
3. WHEN A/B tests are running THEN the system SHALL collect and analyze performance metrics for both variants
4. IF A/B test results are inconclusive THEN the system SHALL extend the test duration or suggest alternative approaches
5. WHEN A/B testing concludes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive reports and automatically promote the winning model
